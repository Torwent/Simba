Backups
#######

Files are automatically backed up every few minutes assuming the file has changed.
The backups are stored as zips in Simba's :code:`data/` directory.

Be warned if you delete the directory Simba is in you will lose all script backups!

-----

You can view the backups in Simba at file > backups.
